## Update 2025
Due to the rise of more projects focused on maintaining TFS 1.4.2 (10.98 protocol) - which was the best and most stable - Iâ€™ve decided to archive MFS.
MFS (formerly TMS) was one of the first projects to commit to upkeeping 1.4.2. Now, with two new projects by new maintainers continuing this work, itâ€™s better to direct you, the users, to them. ðŸ™‚

## What is MFS?

**MFS** is an open source **2D Top Down MMORPG Game Server**, with tailor-made gameplay and tile based movement,  developed in modern C++.
It is abbrevaition of Modern Forgotten Server, and it's also a successor to the *TMS* that has been in work before MFS.
Note: MFS is a fork of the [TFS](https://github.com/otland/forgottenserver) project.

## What is the point of MFS?

The original engine, TFS, has become unstable and is unable (due to time constraints) to develop quickly enough to add newest features while
maintaining stability and quality. That's why, we decided to stay with the 1.4.2 release of it, which has been the most stable.
The point of MFS is to bring stable release that anyone can download && compile effortlessly.

At the moment, as already mentioned MFS is not going in a direction where it will become an engine with rich features.
If you want something like that you can check [BlackTeck](https://github.com/Black-Tek/BlackTek-Server).
MFS's point is to become optimized, compillable, bug-less, stable engine and a base for creators to make their own game of vision become true.
